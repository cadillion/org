** Mathematical Truths that we choose to ignore
*** [[file:20200309153820_aumann_s_agreement_theorem.org][Aumann's agreement theorem]]
**** If you don't agree with me you're a fucking asshole
*** Arrow's Theorem
**** We've had perfect ballots for 40 years and we still can't choose a president
*** Littlewood's law of large numbers
**** 9000 stars can be seen on the darkest night. You can't count for shit.
**** Death rates and mindshare, weird-ass people out there
*** Russel's Paradox
**** A barber shaves everyone who doesn't shave himself, so who shaves the barber?
**** We all contain nothing, just as no one contains everything
*** Godel's Incompleteness Theorem

**** Any consistent language cannot define its own concept of truth
*** Lob's Theorem
**** If you believe you can't, you're right
** Expectations
*** Honest thoughts
    The hardest thing was realizing I would never live up to my own expectations
    I finally put down the chip on my shoulder and didn't know what to do with it
    I knew I'd changed people's lives because people raved about it to me
    I'm afraid to be successful ultimately, afraid to pour my heart in again
    That I'll confirm I'm such an outlier that nobody can actually relate to me
    I achieved one of the dreams that everyone has, but it feels like a sham
    It feels dishonest, a disservice to their frustrated hopes, to be unhappy with my accomplishments
    I feel the distance between my desires and my reality so acutely and I have no
    outlet through which to let those exasperations exorcise themselves
    I'm afraid of failure too. To know I gave it my all and it wasn't enough
    I'm afraid of the dismal and forgettable limbo between failure and success
*** Imitation to find your voice
**** I thought, "I know, I'll copy Ralph Waldo Emerson. He really spoke to me"
**** After some development, I've ended up between Shakespeare and Bukowski
**** The way Shakespeare prefaces his theses with solipsist descents to scatology
**** the way Bukowski cuts the BS "It means life is shit you fuckin' idiots"
**** Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy will
**** You're such a slut, you should totally sleep with me cause c'mon like
     what's one more dick when your vagina is like an ocean full of dicks
** Agitproper
*** If you have to ask for power you have none
*** If conservatives just talked like liberals they could sweep, and vica versa
*** People used to really care about things, cared enough to commit violence!
*** In 1972 there were [[https://status451.com/2017/01/20/days-of-rage/][1900 domestic bombings]] in the US, anarchists and dissidents
** Sociopathy
*** In another life I could have been the unabomber
*** Watching Hannibal reminded me of how badly I want to eat people
*** You know that German guy who got somebody to agree to let him eat them?
*** Why the fuck not!? You're a goddamn adult, consent to be eaten (pussy) is consent to be /eaten/
** Energy Slaves
*** I keep a flog in my room. For the Roomba, in case there's an uprising
*** Endearingly incompetent. Like I have to follow him around to make sure he won't trip up
** Media Diet
*** Pika is the compulsive eating of inedible shit under vitamin deficiency
*** The same thing happens when you starve your brain, your survival instinct
*** We are trapped in a Chinese Room, parroting text which we do ont understand
** Constructed Society
*** Our constructed society is shit
*** Self-care days
**** NO. Self care is fucking bullshit. Self care is something you do so you don't
**** actually have to fix your fucking life. If you have to take a self-care day
**** once a week, you need to change your fucking situation. Shit.
*** Lines on the road
**** As a motorcyclist you realize that all these lines don't mean anything except
     to the cars with flashing lights on top.
**** The fact that nobody defects and fucks with traffic flows is proof of general
     human goodness
*** Overton Window
**** It's turning 30, and suddenly the world of women over 30 has opened to you
     Suddenly they're saying, "Well he's not /that/ young..."

****** Not a whole lot of rioting
*** Modern people think they're socialists but they're just authoritarians
**** Socialism is ownership by people but we instead abdicate control to leaders
** Common Mistakes

make you lean forward?
