** Yes is dangerous
*** Confirmation yeses stop the conversation
*** Commitment yeses are agreement
*** Counterfeit yeses get defenses up
**** Often drawn out "yeeees"
**** Re-ask the question as a no question
*** Reduces autonomy
*** Feels like a concession
*** Still needs a How ("How would you like to proceed?")
** No is golden
*** "Do you disagree?" instead of "Do you agree?"
*** "Are you against...?"
*** "Is it a crazy idea...?"
*** Feels like victory or defense
