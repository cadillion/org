** Give a label to the unsaid elements of their speech
*** Emotions, Fact-patterns, Considerations, Hesitations
*** Can identify pain-points, leverage, win-win situations
*** Reduces emotion after it is labelled
*** Don't use the word I
*** Stop talking after dropping the label
*** Silence is an invitation to expand on the label
*** "It feels like..."
*** "It sounds like you are..."
*** "It sounds like you want..."
*** "It sounds like there might be more behind that..."
