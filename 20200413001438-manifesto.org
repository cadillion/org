* A Proximalist Manifesto
** Tomorrows must be manufactured
*** Past is prologue, and the future owes us nothing
**** History has gravity, and we must exert constant force to escape its pull
**** The future comprises dependent parts, each part created in its own time
**** A dysfunctional future is a lack of imagination
** Power can only be abdicated
*** If you have to ask for power you have none
**** Diplomacy is the abdication of power
**** Force is an admission of powerlessness
**** The only way to retain power is to ask nothing
***** Perfect independent coordination
*** Power extends to the tip of your identity
**** Identities can be expanded with tools and social groups
***** You did not hit my car, you hit me
** Words are violence, words are rape, may the best words reign
*** The only pacifism is silence
**** A word is a cold imposition of my thought upon yours
*** Trial by combat
** You are only as good as your worst critic
*** If tastes are shit then turd your bullion
**** The onus is on the author to be heard
** Everything is true, nothing is permitted
*** Fanaticism is the ultimate arbiter, community the ultimate bailiff
**** Community is power, fanaticism is focus, and they are inversely correlated
**** Franchises leverage both sides of the trade-off
** The profound is the profane
*** Anathemas are beacons of the new frontier
*** Look for novelty in the rote, the taboo, and the disconnected
**** Familiar environments elide details
**** Forbidden environments expose needs for which people will break custom
**** Fragmented environments hide unrecognized combinations of interest
** Agree on the causes, dispute on the values
*** We must agree on consequences, we can disagree how to feel about it
