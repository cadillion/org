* Notes
** Handshakes require intimacy:
*** Rapport with the seller is necessary to buy
*** Transactions are visible only to participants
** Dark markets require membership: wares and knowledge are highly specialized
*** Esoteric knowledge required to earn membership and to trade
*** Transactions are only visible to the membership
** Malls require intent: wares are advertised and location-specific
*** You find nothing unless you are looking for it, but search is easy
*** Transactions are only visible to those who are co-located
** Bazaars require presence: wares are broadly available and unfiltered
*** Anyone can set up shop so all things are available, if hard to find
*** Transactions are visible to everyone
